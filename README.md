## Features
Key Features:
- Data Cleaning 
- Tokenization
- Normalization
- Noise Removal

<!--Usage -->
## Usage
Usage:
- **Removing Special Characters and Punctuation:**
  - NLP techniques can help clean text data by eliminating special characters, punctuation marks, and symbols that might hinder analysis.

- **Handling Contractions and Abbreviations:**
  - Utilizing NLP, contractions and abbreviations within text data can be expanded or resolved for better text understanding and analysis.

- **Lowercasing and Normalization:**
  - NLP facilitates converting text to lowercase and normalizing it by standardizing case formats, making text uniform for further processing.

### Preprocessing Techniques with NLP
- **Tokenization:**
  - NLP provides tokenization methods to split text into tokens (words, phrases, or sentences), aiding in feature extraction and analysis.

- **Stemming and Lemmatization:**
  - NLP techniques like stemming and lemmatization reduce words to their base or root forms, reducing dimensionality and aiding in text normalization.

- **Removing Stopwords:**
  - NLP can identify and remove common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that add little value to analysis or modeling tasks.
